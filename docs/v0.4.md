## :construction: BTMD v0.4 :construction:

A new version of the BTMD project is currently in the works.
The goal is to design a custom rear shell to house the additional hardware, without the need for removing the recording mechanism, and hopefully with a better placement of the Bluetooth antenna for better range and signal stability. The mod will likely be performed on a [MZ-R700](https://www.minidisc.wiki/equipment/sony/portable/mz-r700) MD Walkman.
